## Why?

 - Blogs are fun
 - Cutting edge deployment tech
 - Useful as boilerplate for servers

## Install

```sh
git clone git@github.com:sholladay/seth-holladay.com.git &&
cd seth-holladay.com &&
cp .env.example .env &&
npm link
```

To actually start the server and run the app, you will need credentials in order to connect to [web services](#web-services), such as Stripe. Once you have them, put them in `.env`.

**Note: Do not put any credentials in `.env.example`!** That file is committed to the repository and [putting secrets in there is unsafe](http://blog.arvidandersson.se/2013/06/10/credentials-in-git-repos). It is used to document and validate which credentials belong in `.env`. The latter is ignored and cannot be committed accidentally.

## Usage

```console
  Usage
    $ seth-holladay.com

  Option
    --port        Port number to listen on for HTTPS requests
    --open        Open the homepage in your browser
    --open=<url>  Open a specific page in your browser

  Example
    $ seth-holladay.com
    Seth ready at https://localhost/
    $ seth-holladay.com --port=7000
    Seth ready at https://localhost:7000/
```

## Continuous delivery

All commits, including pull requests, are tested by [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/about/).

For the `master` branch only, commits are also [deployed](https://github.com/sholladay/seth-holladay.com/blob/master/deploy.sh) to [dev.seth-holladay.com](https://dev.seth-holladay.com) within a few minutes of being pushed.

See the latest CI results at: https://circleci.com/gh/sholladay/seth-holladay.com
